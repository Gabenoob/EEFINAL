  abstract = {Image denoising is a kind of technology that uses the context information of image sequence to remove noise and restore clear image. It is one of the important research contents in the field of computer vision. With the development of machine learning, deep learning has been widely used in the field of image denoising, and has become an effective solution for image denoising. Firstly, the deep learning image denoising method is analyzed. Secondly, the idea of image denoising method is analyzed in detail according to the network structure, and the advantages and disadvantages are summarized. Then, through the experimental results on DND, PolyU and other data sets, the performance of deep learning based image denoising methods is compared and analyzed. Finally, the key issues of image denoising research are summarized, and the future development trend of the research of this field is discussed. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = { In this paper we propose a generic recursive algorithm for improving image denoising methods. Given the initial denoised image, we suggest repeating the following “SOS” procedure: (i) Strengthen the signal by adding the previous denoised image to the degraded input image, (ii) Operate the denoising method on the strengthened image, and (iii) Subtract the previous denoised image from the restored signal-strengthened outcome. The convergence of this process is studied for the K-SVD image denoising and related algorithms. Still in the context of K-SVD image denoising, we introduce an interesting interpretation of the SOS algorithm as a technique for closing the gap between the local patch-modeling and the global restoration task, thereby leading to improved performance. In a quest for the theoretical origin of the SOS algorithm, we provide a graph-based interpretation of our method, where the SOS recursive update effectively minimizes a penalty function that aims to denoise the image, while being regularized by the graph Laplacian. We demonstrate the SOS boosting algorithm for several leading denoising methods (K-SVD, NLM, BM3D, and EPLL), showing its tendency to further improve denoising performance. }

  abstract = { Abstract.We propose a novel model for decomposing grayscale images into three distinct components: the structural part, representing sharp boundaries and regions with strong light-to-dark transitions; the smooth part, capturing soft shadows and shades; and the oscillatory part, characterizing textures and noise. To capture the homogeneous structures, we introduce a combination of \(L^0\)-gradient and curvature regularization on level lines. This new regularization term enforces strong sparsity on the image gradient while reducing the undesirable staircase effects as well as preserving the geometry of contours. For the smoothly varying component, we utilize the \(L^2\)-norm of the Laplacian that favors isotropic smoothness. To capture the oscillation, we use the inverse Sobolev seminorm. To solve the associated minimization problem, we design an efficient operator-splitting algorithm. Our algorithm effectively addresses the challenging nonconvex nonsmooth problem by separating it into subproblems. Each subproblem can be solved either directly using closed-form solutions or efficiently using the fast Fourier transform. We provide systematic experiments, including ablation and comparison studies, to analyze our model’s behaviors and demonstrate its effectiveness as well as efficiency. }

  abstract = {With the explosion in the number of digital images taken every day, the demand for more accurate and visually pleasing images is increasing. However, the images captured by modern cameras are inevitably degraded by noise, which leads to deteriorated visual image quality. Therefore, work is required to reduce noise without losing image features (edges, corners, and other sharp structures). So far, researchers have already proposed various methods for decreasing noise. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we summarize some important research in the field of image denoising. First, we give the formulation of the image denoising problem, and then we present several image denoising techniques. In addition, we discuss the characteristics of these techniques. Finally, we provide several promising directions for future research.},

  abstract = {At the crossing of the statistical and functional analysis, there exists a relentless quest for an efficient image denoising algorithm. In terms of greyscale imaging, a plethora of denoising algorithms have been documented in the literature, in spite of which the level of functionality of these algorithms still holds margin to acquire desired level of applicability. Quite often noise affecting the pixels in image is Gaussian in nature and uniformly deters information pixels in image. Based on some specific set of assumptions all methods work optimally, however they tend to create artefacts and remove fine structural details under general conditions. This article focuses on classifying and comparing some of the significant works in the field of denoising.}
